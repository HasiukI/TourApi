# TourApi
 A simple site for tours, I know the design can be better.

 This application is written in Angular and Asp.Net. All photos are located on a local folder on the server (backend), which is the C# ASP .NET API. Angular(Fronted) for all files and data refers to the server.
 **Also have a backend on PHP Laravel.**
